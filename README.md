# fm-tcn-spld
Use self-pace learning to realize multi-modal data fusion, wide part is fm, deep part is tcn

this is the project which disign the model to realize the classification about URLs,facilities Wide&Deep thought,FM(Factorization Machines) is Choosen at Wide part,and TCN( temporal convolutional network) is designed at Deep part, in addition,we use a new training method called self-paced learning with diversity(spld) to fuse the FM and TCN. As the result shows,the model we proposed is efficient and better than baseline model.
